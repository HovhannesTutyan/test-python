AttributeError: module 'json' has no attribute 'loads'

sys.path contains a list of locations to find in when searching for a module.
Note that the current working directory is denoted by an empty string (‚Äù).

According to the official document for sys.path, the first location in sys.path is the directory containing the script.
As we were just testing in the interactive shell, there was no script directory.
As a result, the first location in sys.path became an empty string, indicating that it will look for the modules in the current working directory first.
